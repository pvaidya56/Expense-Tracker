This was a side project built during my Full Stack Developement program at Lambda School. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to track their expense overtime. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding Context API for state management and on the server-side I used Node.js and Express. 

 In the next iteration I plan on adding authentication to this application.
